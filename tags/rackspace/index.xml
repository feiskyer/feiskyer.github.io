      <description>What is Carina? Carina is a container runtime environment (currently in Beta) that offers performance, container-native tools, and portability without sacrificing ease of use. You can get started in minutes by using open-source software on managed infrastructure to run your containerized applications.
Your containers run in a bare-metal environment, which avoids the &amp;ldquo;hypervisor tax&amp;rdquo; on performance. Applications in this environment launch as much as 20 percent faster and run as much as 60 percent faster.</description>
