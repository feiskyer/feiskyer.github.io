&lt;p>Carina is a container runtime environment (currently in Beta) that offers performance, container-native tools, and portability without sacrificing ease of use. You can get started in minutes by using open-source software on managed infrastructure to run your containerized applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your containers run in a bare-metal environment, which avoids the &amp;ldquo;hypervisor tax&amp;rdquo; on performance. Applications in this environment launch as much as 20 percent faster and run as much as 60 percent faster. This environment builds on the standard restrictions set out by libcontainer by using an AppArmor profile as an additional security layer to keep your resources isolated.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
