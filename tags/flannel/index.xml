&lt;p>Flannel is a virtual network that gives a subnet to each host for use with container runtimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Platforms like Google&amp;rsquo;s Kubernetes assume that each container (pod) has a unique, routable IP inside the cluster. The advantage of this model is that it reduces the complexity of doing port mapping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>flannel runs an agent, flanneld, on each host and is responsible for allocating a subnet lease out of a preconfigured address space. flannel uses etcd to store the network configuration, allocated subnets, and auxiliary data (such as host&amp;rsquo;s IP). The forwarding of packets is achieved using one of several strategies that are known as backends. The simplest backend is udp and uses a TUN device to encapsulate every IP fragment in a UDP packet, forming an overlay network. The following diagram demonstrates the path a packet takes as it traverses the overlay network:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
