[LaraMod](https://github.com/htr3n/laramod) is another modularisation effort to systematically organising a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) based project. The idea stems from my struggle to structure a Laravel-based project so that I can work effectively on individual modules whilst keeping Laravel codebase intact as much as possible and also keeping the project's codebase separate from Laravel.
